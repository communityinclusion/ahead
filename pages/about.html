<p>The CEDAR Database was developed and is maintained by the National Center on College Students with Disabilities (NCCSD), a federally funded project administered by the Association on Higher Education and Disability (AHEAD). The NCCSD provides technical assistance and support for college students with disabilities and their families, as well as training and resources for colleges and universities. We are dedicated to promoting more inclusive and equitable college environments for people with disabilities.</p>

<p>Many thanks to our colleagues at the Institute for Community Inclusion at the University of Massachusetts, Boston for their technical expertise, guidance, and support in the development of this database.</p>
